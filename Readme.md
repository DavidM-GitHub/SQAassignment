## Task Estimation Justification
I used T-Shirt sizes for estimating each of the tasks in my sprint backlog because it is a simple, easy to use technique and it allowed me to estimate the tasks without putting a specific time on them which was helpful because I dont have a vast amount of experience developing components through Test Driven Development so I was finding it difficult to put an exact time on each task. I labelled what I thought would be the simplest tasks XS which would be a method to create a new Rubric or a new StudentGrade, methods that should only require one or two lines of code. I labelled tasks S if I felt they would be relatively easy to implement but require a little more thinking than a simple method call. If you compare the Method to create a rubric (XS) to the Method to get specific Rubric by name (S) it is clear to see the latter would require a bit more computation but would still be relatively simple. M was given to tasks that consisted of a number of smaller tasks like providing summary calculations or investigating the code coverage, both tasks consisting of a number of smalller tasks that together make up a medium weighted task. I labelled the tasks that a felt required a substantial amount of effort L in this case L carrys the most weight in the sprint backlog and this is the task that consists of a large number of tasks which are labelled XS, S and M which is creating the controller task. Comparing this task with the task of investigating the code coverage tool (M) it is easy to see the difference in weight with the latter container a lot fewer tasks and each of them being labelled S and XS.

## Velocity Metric
Velocity is a good metric for measuring the rate at which scrum teams regularly deliver working products and product functionality. This can be very useful in many ways including predicting how much work will get done in a sprint and judging the time it will take to complete certain pieces of a product. In order to calculate sprint velocity you must:
- Count the story points completed in each sprint
- Calculate the average of completed story points accross a number of sprints  

Note that I have estimated the tasks above using T-shirt sizes. In this case in order to calculate the sprint velocity you would need to assign numberic values to the sizes.
Once you have a general idea of the amount of work the team can do in a certain amount of time, sprint planning becomes a lot easier and a the task estimates get more accurate.
